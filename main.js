// Student Grades
// Copy and paste the folowing array of grades into your JavaScript file:
var grades = [92, 91, 75, 66, 52, 90, 83, 85, 64, 90, 72, 88, 77, 98, 100, 73, 92]
// Loop through the grades with a for loop
// If the current grade is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 69, log "You got an F" to the console.
// If it's between 70 and 76, log "You got a D" to the console.
// If it's between 77 and 84, log "You got a C" to the console.
// If it's between 84 and 92, log "You got a B" to the console.
// If it's between 93 and 100, log "You got an A" to the console.
// Student Grades: Part 2
// Utilizing the array from the student grades exercise above, each entry in the array represents a different student's percentage grade for the entire course:

// Use JavaScript to answer the following questions:

// How many students got A's?
// How many students got B's?
// Which was the most common letter grade?
// What was the average percentage grade in the class?
